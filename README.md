## AdBot2000

The CY_BORG system for Foundry comes with its own fake ad engine. You're welcome.

Because you aren't actually stuck in CY, you can use system settings to turn off ads or tailor their behavior.

* Show chat ads - whether to display ads in chat.
* Chat ad delay - how many seconds between each ad. Note that other, regular chat messages will reset this delay.
* Show popup ads - whether to show popup ads, which can be triggered by various actions on the character sheet.
* Popup ad chance - percent chance to show a popup ad.
* Popup ad instead - extra-special evil... whether the popup ad blocks the original intended action or not.
* Sound effects - whether to play various system sound effects, including ad open/close.
