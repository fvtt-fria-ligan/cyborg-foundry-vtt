Also check out the Random Tables compendium for roll tables covering random choices of various things (e.g., apps) as well as character creation. [Thanks again to the CY creators, Christian and Johan, for their explicit permission to include this content.]</p><p></p><h2>Characters</h2><p>The system has 3 types of actors - Characters, NPCs, and Vehicles - that can be created in the usual Foundry way (Actors tab, Create actor, choose type).</p><p></p><p>The system also includes a character generator, available either through the \"Make a Punk\" button on the Actors tab (requires actor creation permission) or the \"Reboot\" button on an existing character sheet (just requires ownership of that particular character).</p><p></p><p>A character's class is represented as an owned item (of type Class). To change a character's class, drag and drop a new class from a class compendium (e.g., \"Class - Discharged CorpKiller\"), or Reboot.</p><p></p><h2>Combat</h2><ul><li><p>To roll party initiative, use the \"Initiative\" button on any character's sheet on the combat (pistol icon) tab.</p></li><li><p>To defend, use the \"Defend\" button on the character's combat tab. A popup window will open asking you for the DR and the incoming attack damage (which we assume the GM tells you). Figuring out the defense success is then automated, and is the damage roll. Deducting the hit points is done manually by you; there's a Broken button on the character sheet if you reach 0 hit points.</p></li><li><p>To attack, use the \"Attack\" button for an owned weapon on the combat tab. A popup window will open asking you for the target DR, as well as checkboxes for autofire, whether the target is a vehicle, etc. Figuring out the attack and damage is then automated. Deducting the hit points from the target is done manually by the GM.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>Apps and Nano</h2><p>Apps and Nano will appear on the Nano/Apps tab, along with tracking of the number each will fumble on. Each app/nano has a \"Use\" button next to it. An App's edit sheet has a \"burned\" checkbox.</p><p></p><h2>Feats</h2><p>Some classes (e.g., Forsaken Gang-Goon) have special abilities that show up on the Feats tab.</p><p></p><h2>AdBot2000</h2><p>The CY system for Foundry includes its very own ad system. You're welcome? Ads show up in two different places: in the chat window via a timer, or as popups when characters press buttons on their character sheet. The timing and behavior of AdBot2000 is configurable by the GM in the system settings.</p><p></p><h2>Sound Effects</h2><p>The system has sound effects for various UI events (clicks, window open/close, etc). Weapon sound effects can be selected in the Weapon edit sheet. Sound effects can be disabled per player in the system settings.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.DWCDVduMjr4wseja"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"cy-borg","systemVersion":"1.0.0","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1667508387141,"modifiedTime":1669305910480,"lastModifiedBy":"CpCcIZDbSoZqQZeD"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"b2QNVmhp9Nus7jmA":3},"_id":"MoXtTrUL7R7Ksr3v"}
